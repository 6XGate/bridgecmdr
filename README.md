## Installation

To install BridgeCmdr on the Raspberry Pi, all you need do is download the
[latest release](https://github.com/6XGate/bridgecmdr/releases) and install it with
`sudo apt install ./bridgecmdr_<version>-<revision>_armhf.deb -y`

### System Requirements

I've only tested this software on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. In general I would recommend at minimal a Raspberry Pi 3
Model B or better. Which would include every configuration of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. It may run on other models,
but this has not been tested.

You will also need a touchscreen, such as the official Raspberry Pi touchscreen, or a mouse and screen. You will also
need a keyboard while setting up your configuration, but it is not needed during day-to-day use.

You may also need additional USB-to-serial adapters or a serial HAT. Some supported monitors and switches can be
controlled over ethernet. For those you will need an ethernet cable; and if you have more than one such device, an
ethernet hub or switch. See [Wiki](https://github.com/6XGate/bridgecmdr/wiki) for more information on how to connect to
supported monitors and switches.

## Building

### Development

If you want to help with the development of BridgeCmdr, downloading, building, then running the project on a GNU/Linux
based operating system is required. The following steps will get you setup on a Debian-base operating system.

1. Install the `build-essential` package; `sudo apt install build-essential -y`
2. Acquire the source:
    - **Preferred**, Fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/6XGate/bridgecmdr), you may then issue pull
      requests back to the official source code. Also start personal branches from `develop`.
    - Download the [source](https://github.com/6XGate/bridgecmdr/archive/develop.zip) and extract it.
3. Open a terminal clone and go to the folder into which source was cloned or extracted.
4. Install the node packages; `npm ci`
5. Build the user interface source; `npm run prod` or `npm run dev`

You should now be able to run the program with `npm run start`.

### Packaging the Installer

To package or build the install, you will need to follow the above steps you acquire the a working copy of the source
code on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian, the only supported operating system.

There are two ways to build the installer package depending on which model of Raspberry Pi you have.

#### Using a 1GiB Raspberry Pi and a desktop computer.

The following systems must use this method:

- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
- 1GiB Raspberry Pi 4 Model B,
- Any model with lesser specs than those above, though this is as untested as running BridgeCmdr on it.

Though not optimal, the only way to build a package on a 1GiB Raspberry Pi is to use a desktop computer running a
GNU/Linux based operating system to build the user interface and the Pi to build the installer package.

1. On both systems, install the node packages; `npm ci`
2. On the desktop system, build the user interface source; `npm run prod`
3. Copy the `dist` folder from the desktop system to project folder on the Raspberry Pi system.
4. Package the installer on the Raspberry Pi system; `npm run pack`

#### Using Raspberry Pi with more RAM.

If you are running a Raspberry Pi 4 with 2GiB or 4GiB, all instructions can be done without copying the user interface
files and you will only use that single system. This is a simplest process.

1. Install the node packages; `npm ci`
2. Build the installer package; `npm run package`

#### The Package

You should now have a Raspbian package ending in `.deb` in the `out` folder. This package can be installed with `apt` on
the Raspberry Pi.
