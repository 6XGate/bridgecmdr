## Building

### Development

If you want to help with the development of BridgeCmdr, downloading, building, and running the project on a Linux system
is easy.

1. Download the [source](https://github.com/6XGate/bridgecmdr/archive/master.zip) and extract it.
2. Open a terminal clone and go to the folder into which source was extracted.
3. Install the `build-essential` package.
    - `sudo apt install build-essential -y`
4. Install the node packages.
    - `npm ci` or `npm install`
5. Build the user interface source.
    - `npm run prod` or `npm run dev`

You should now be able to run the program with `npm run start`.

### Packaging the Installer

Though not optimal, the only way to currently building a package requires a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian and a desktop
computer running Debian or Ubuntu.  This should change in the future.  Other desktop Linux distributions may work, but
 it's not tested.

 With a Raspberry Pi 4, given the larger memory configuration, it may be possible to do all of this on the Raspberry Pi
 system alone.

1. Download the [source](https://github.com/6XGate/bridgecmdr/archive/develop.zip) and extract it on both systems.
2. On both systems; open a terminal clone and go to the folder into which source was extracted.
3. On both systems; install the `build-essential` package.
    - `sudo apt install build-essential -y`
4. On both systems; install the node packages.
    - `npm ci` or `npm install`
5. On the desktop system, build the user interface source.
    - `npm run prod` or `npm run dev`
6. Copy the `dist` folder from the desktop system to project folder on the Raspberry Pi system.
7. Package the installer on the Raspberry Pi system.
    - `npm run pack`

You should now have a Debian package in the `out` folder. This package can be installed with `apt` on the Raspberry Pi.
